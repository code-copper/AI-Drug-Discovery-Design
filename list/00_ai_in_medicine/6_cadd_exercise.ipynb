    "In this notebook, the experience gained in the first week will be applied to perform a virtual screening experiment for inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor ([EGFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor)) via machine learning. First, computer-friendly molecular representations will be introduced, which allow the training of machine learning models. Next, a support vector machine will be trained to classify molecules as active or inactive. The trained model will be used to predict the activity of a small molecule set. Finally, successful participants can check their hits for potential activity against EGFR via online resources."
